# 0x04 Loops, Conditions and Parsing - Bash Scripts

This project contains Bash scripts designed to help learners practice loops, conditional statements, and basic input parsing in Linux shell scripting.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build foundational Bash scripting skills focusing on:

- Using `for`, `while`, and `until` loops
- Applying conditional logic with `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Handling input and output with parsing techniques
- Automating repetitive tasks and making decisions in scripts

By completing the tasks, you will be able to write dynamic and responsive shell scripts.
