# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

This project introduces basic shell scripting concepts related to:

- Standard input/output redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`)
- Using common commands like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `echo`, `find`
- Working with special characters in filenames
- Filtering and processing text
- Deleting files with specific extensions

## Directory Structure

Each task is implemented as a separate script file, all located in this folder. Every script begins with `#!/bin/bash` and is executable.

## How to Use

To run a script:

```bash
./filename
